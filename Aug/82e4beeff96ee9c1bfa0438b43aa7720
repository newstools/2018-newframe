Rwandan politician Diane Rwigara was jailed soon after she attempted to stand against Rwandan President Paul Kagame in the  August 2017 elections. She was disqualified from the race and then charged with fraud and incitement -- but her real offence, supporters say, is to challenge Kagame's autocratic regime. Many other Rwandan opposition activists and journalists have been jailed, exiled or assassinated in recent years.
